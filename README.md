## Rules of the game
Game will show a set of stars between 1 - 9.
You may select numbers that match the count of stars, selected numbers will be shown to the right.
For example, 5 stars are shown. You can select 5 OR (3 + 2). (NOTE: Game uses addition only, not multiplication)

After you selected the numbers you press the EQUAL button, it's flagged green if it passes or red if it doesn't add up.
Press the button again to confirm your choice. The confirmation will flag the selected numbers as disabled.
Therefor you may only use a number once.

If you can't find a possible solution you may use the refresh button, this will redraw the stars at random.
You may use this button a total of five times.

You win if you have used all numbers!
You will lose if the time runs out or you have no possible solutions left after you used all your resets.




## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
